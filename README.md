# DO NOT TURN IN ASSIGNMENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE ASSIGNS THEM

also please please please just use this as answer key and actually do the projects, this was just supposed to be a collection of useful study materials and potential assistance if you get stuck on a lab.

- Graded assignments are under `AP_CSA_sem1/src/GradedLabs`
- Useful practice labs are under `AP_CSA_sem1/src/UsefulPractice`

To get started, click the green `<> Code` button then download as zip

if you're cool you can install git and clone the repository using the link under `<> Code` but do NOT try to commit any changes to main I will reject your PR
## IF YOU FIND THAT ANYTHING IS MISSING FROM HERE (I.E. he changes the curriculum) please notify me to make a Pull request

you can make your own branch and push to that if you'd like

Over the summer, I plan on documenting all of this code and making helpful comments/tips within the files, as well as normalizing the naming conventions
